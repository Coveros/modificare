1. Requirements:

Java
Perl
R

2. Installation instructions:

Additional requirements for R:
gplots
plotrix

To install these packages for R:

Enter the R environment
>R

Install gplots
>install.packages("gplots")

Select a CRAN mirror and the package will be automatically downloaded and 
installed.

Install plotrix
>install.packages("plotrix")

The previously selected CRAN mirror will be used and the package will be 
automatically downloaded and installed.

Exit the R environment
>q()

3. Instructions for use

First generate data using SCATTR.jar

<name> is the desired label of the output such as jfreechart_src, 
jfreechart_test /path/to/directory is the highest level directory containing 
the code to be analyzed; for jfreechart_src, use the path to the jfreechart 
source directory

>java -jar SCATT.jar <name> /path/to/directory

All data must be collected into the 3 files src.txt, test.txt, and full.txt 
located in SCATTR/data.  This data must have the proper column headers as shown 
in the samples and the applications must appear in the same order across all 
files.  The format must be correct, no extra line breaks or unneccessary text, 
or else histo_translate.pl will not work.

Once the data is collected and properly formatted, execute 
SCATTR/histo_translate.pl to translate the previously collected data into a 
format that can be used to generate histogram graphs.  These new data files 
will be located in SCATTR/data as ccn_histo.txt, javadoc_histo.txt, and 
ncss_histo.txt.

>./histo_translate.pl

Now that the data exists, the graphs can be generated using R.  Simply run the 
gen_graphs.R Rscript with the desired command arguments to generate the desired 
graphs.

To generate just scatter plots with no linear regression line of best fit:

>Rscript gen_graphs.R s

To generate just scatter plots with linear regression enabled:

>Rscript gen_graphs.R r

To generate just the histograms:

>Rscript gen_graphs.R h

To generate just the bar charts:

>Rscript gen_graphs.R b

To generate all graphs with linear regression enabled for the scatter plots, 
execute the script with no command arguments:

>Rscript gen_graphs.R

The graphs will be generated and saved in the SCATTR/graphs directory along 
with extra statistical analysis data from the scatter plot linear regression 
calculations. 

I have included jfreechart in the sample directory.  That directory also 
contains all the base data collected as part of lab 2.
